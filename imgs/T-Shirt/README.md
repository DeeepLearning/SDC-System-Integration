[T-Shirt-without-background-for-print.png](https://github.com/diyjac/SDC-System-Integration/blob/rainer-rev3/imgs/T-Shirt/T-Shirt-without-background-for-print.png)


The template was generated on an iPad using the [Inkpad for iPad 1.6](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inkpad-vector-graphic-design-illustration/id1057007769?mt=8). The template was exported as svg to be used in compatible software as well but not tested yet.
