This directory contains the template for our T-Shirt print. The files to be used for printing the T-Shirt are 
[front](https://github.com/diyjac/SDC-System-Integration/blob/rainer4-classifier/imgs/T-Shirt/release9/front4print/front-team-vulture-carl9-two.png) and [back](https://github.com/diyjac/SDC-System-Integration/blob/rainer4-classifier/imgs/T-Shirt/release9/back4print/back-team-vulture-carl9-two.png)


The template was generated on an iPad using the [InkPad 2](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/inkpad-2/id988700301?mt=8). The template was exported as svg to be used in compatible software as well but not tested yet.
